# Centrally Deployed Templates Solution (CDTS)

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/opc-cpvp/cdts-sgdc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opc-cpvp/cdts-sgdc)

The purpose of the [Centrally Deployed Templates Solution (CDTS)](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc) is essentially to deliver the presentation layer of the `Canada.ca` or `intranet.canada.ca` themes to web assets. It decouples the presentation layer from the business logic of a static website or web application and allows rapid updates across multiple networks.

### Security

Please see [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information.

#### Install dependencies
Clone this repository to a local directory. On the command line move to the cloned directory ( this directory should contain the package.json file) and run : `$ npm install`.
This command will read the package.json and install the npm dependencies to the *node_modules* directory.

#### Builds

The _soy_ files are compiled with [grunt-soy-compile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-soy-compile).

This project uses the [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) modules to get the dependencies needed, build, minify and deploy the final JavaScript modules.

#### Development
To create a development build of the modules on the command line move to the cloned directory and run: `$ npm run build`

This command will:

1. Empty the `dist` and `tmp` folder
2. Compile the soy files using [grunt-soy-compile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-soy-compile) into the `tmp` folder
3. Copy and rename and concat the compiled `js` files into the `dist`
4. Copy the `gcweb` and `wet-boew` files from the `node_modules` folder in the `dist` 
5. Copy all the other assets (JS, CSS, HTML) files from the `_src` in the `dist/cdts` folder
6. Delete the `tmp` folder

#### To Do:

* Setup git [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for sample pages, added issue [#7](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc/issues/7)
* Use a CI to tests source code, added issue [#8](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc/issues/8)
* Use CI to deploy `dist` folder to servers, added issue [#9](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc/issues/9)

#### Related repositories

##### [cdts-sgdc-cdn](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc-cdn)

Used to host the `dist` folder to be able to pull to different servers. [Travis.CI](https://travis-ci.org/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc) is used to build and then deploy to these secondary repositories within the coffee scripts. Will create a branch with the curent version number. And tags for releases. 

##### [cdts-sgdc-dist](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc-dist)

Not sure what this is for but WET has it. Might get rid of it, might keep it. WET uses to host all their working files.

##### [cdts-sgdc-releases](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc-releases)

Holds all the releases so that servers can pull from this repository onto the CDNs.

#### Grunt tasks scripts breakdown

##### default: `npx grunt`

Default task that runs the core unminified `build`

##### dist: `npx grunt dist`

Produces the production files, which is `build` + `minify`

##### build: `npx grunt build`

Run full build.

##### minify: `npx grunt minify`

Minify built files.

##### deploy: `npx grunt deploy`

Build and deploy artifacts to cdts-sgdc-cdn (Only works on Travis-ci.org)

## Nice to have

* Sass or post-css
* Something to generate the sample HTML files (jekyll)

## New DNS structure

We would like to setup a new DNS new path for the CDTS JS files.

Looking at maybe one of these:

* sgdc-cdts.canada.ca/v1.0.1/cdts/js/gcweb-en.js
* cdts.canada.ca/v1.0.1/cdts/js/gcweb-en.js
* sgdc.canada.ca/v1.0.1/cdts/js/gcweb-en.js
