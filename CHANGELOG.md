# CDTS Change Log

## v5.0.0
- **IMPORTANT** **BREAKING CHANGE** Exitscript no longer uses targetUrl as part of the query string to pass the destination link. Please visit the [sample page](https://cdts.service.canada.ca/app/cls/WET/gcweb/v5_0_0/cdts/samples/exitscript-en.html) for all the details.

## v4.1.0

- Introducing a new **OPTIONAL** way for clients to reference CDTS that avoids the need for `document.write`, having to call multiple CDTS functions and optionally the need for inline scripts altogether. **Backwards compatibility to seperate CDTS functions was preserved.** For details, refer to documentation for [GCWeb](https://cenw-wscoe.github.io/sgdc-cdts/docs/internet-en.html) and [GCIntranet](https://cenw-wscoe.github.io/sgdc-cdts/docs/intranet-en.html) and [corresponding sample pages](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc/blob/master/public/gcweb/samples/nodoc-write-en.html) (other sample pages are still using document.write and will be updated later).
- Added support for Sub Resource Integrity (SRI)
  - CDTS can now include SRI hash values when including libraries and internal files on the page.  This is controlled by the `sriEnabled` boolean parameter in calling refTop, refFooter or the new setup function.
  - For clients to make use of SRI when referencing CDTS, hash values to public files are available for [GCWeb](https://www.canada.ca/etc/designs/canada/cdts/gcweb/v4_1_0/cdts/SRI-INFO.md) and [GCIntranet](https://cdts.service.canada.ca/app/cls/WET/gcintranet/v4_1_0/cdts/SRI-INFO.md)

- **IMPORTANT** GCIntranet URLs https://ssl-templates.services.gc.ca and https://templates.services.gc.ca have been replaced by https://cdts.service.canada.ca hosted in the cloud.
