	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>The CDTS was built due to the Sustain Compliance on Web Accessibility Standard for the Internet (SCWASI) project at ESDC. The SCWASI project is a multi-year project at ESDC with the goal of ensuring compliance with TBS mandated standards on accessibility, usability, and interoperability for public-facing web assets. SCWASI makes it easier and less costly to meet Web Standards for all public web sites and business applications. It introduces a consistent approach for managing the presentation layer of our public facing web assets. The main key is to keep all content in one place, all managed the same way, create once and use many times.</p>
	<p>The CDTS was also built to respond to evolving needs for web assets to be more agile and reduce cost related to performing releases for presentation layer elements. These items are explained below:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Modernized web architecture for websites and web applications is in place to effectively use centrally managed and deployed presentation components and integrate with primary sites.
			<ul>
				<li>The proposed solution will be built upon a CDN (Content Delivery Network) model where web assets (static or dynamic) will be able to “call” presentation components without need for worry concerning platform such as .NET or JAVA.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Web applications are able to “call” presentation layer components from a central location, dynamic delivery platform is in place.
			<ul>
				<li>Web applications will be able to “call” presentation components through the Google Closure Templates (GCT) technology. There is also a static fall-back mechanism in case JavaScript is disabled. The advantage to using GCT is that these “calls” are platform independent as they are run on the client side and not the server side. This means we can cater the CDTS to any web asset currently running on our environment such as .NET/JAVA/HTML5.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Web developers separate presentation components from content and business functionality. This allows us to update presentation layer components without “opening the hood” on every web application.
			<ul>
				<li>Documentation has been created for developers that includes an overview of the framework and how to implement the “calls” to the presentation components. Documentation also details specific “scenarios” such as secure links and how they will be managed through the presentation components.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>CDTS highlights</h2>
	<p>Web assets will follow the instructions in the Internet/Intranet/Applications tabs above for implementation of the CDTS. This involves simple modifications to your web asset in order to replace your existing presentation layer with the one provided by the CDTS. As well as providing the presentation layer you can also configure multiple options that are customizable as per the Canada.ca theme C&IA specifications.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>CDTS includes “verification” mechanism</h2>
	<p>The CDTS offers two different implementation types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>RUN version - In this version the web asset will always use LATEST version of all files. They never have to worry about what version of WET they are using or if they are up to date with Canada.ca changes because these changes are all automatically pushed to their website with each change or release.</li>
		<li>APP version - Some web assets expressed the need to test any changes on their website. Given the sometimes highly complex and/or secure aspect of their web asset they need to perform a test to ensure no changes have an impact on the web asset. These web assets will use a version # in their calls to the CDTS and it will allow them to perform testing of the new changes before applying them to their web assets in production. Once testing has been performed the web assets can update production to reflect the new version #.</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>CDTS includes automated updates</h2>
	<p>All web assets will obtain automatically any changes and/or updates to the Canada.ca site menu through the Canada.ca CDN.</p>
